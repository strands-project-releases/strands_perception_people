opencv_warco
============

A C++, OpenCV-based reimplementation of Tosato's WARCO image classification
algorithm.

This is an **unfinished experiment**, still highly in flux. It will not work.
It will break. It might microwave your cat. It might classify pictures of heads
according to their gaze direction.
