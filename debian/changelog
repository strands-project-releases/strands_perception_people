  * Making camera topic reconfigurable
    So far only the camera namespace was configurable but that introduced an implicit dependency on the openni_wrapper.
    With these changes the whole topic is reconfigurable via a parameter, e.g.:
    camera_namespace:=/my_cam
    depth_image:=/depth/image
    results in /my_cam/depth/image as a topic for the depth image. So camera_namespace + depth_image = the topic on which to look for the depth image.
